# Word Guessing Game

## Overview

This Python program is a simple word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly selected word from a predefined list. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether each letter in the guess matches the solution in the correct position.

## Features

1. **Interactive Gameplay**  
   - Players are prompted to guess a 5-letter word.
   - Feedback is given for each guess with visual indicators.
2. **Feedback System**  
   - **游릭**: Correct letter in the correct position.
   - **游댮**: Incorrect letter or wrong position.
3. **Random Word Selection**  
   - The solution word is randomly chosen from a predefined list of common words.
4. **Victory Condition**  
   - If the player guesses the word correctly, the game ends with a congratulatory message.
5. **Attempts Limit**  
   - Players have up to 6 attempts to guess the word. If unsuccessful, the solution is revealed.

## Functions Explained

### **Core Functions**

1. **`get_guess()`**  
   Prompts the user to input a guess and converts it to uppercase for uniformity.

2. **`print_word(word)`**  
   Displays the guessed word with each letter separated by a space.

3. **`exact_match_compare(solution, guess)`**  
   Compares the player's guess with the solution and returns a string of indicators:
   - **游릭** for correct matches.
   - **游댮** for incorrect matches.

4. **`one_turn(solution)`**  
   Executes one turn of the game:
   - Prompts the user for a guess.
   - Displays the guess and feedback.
   - Checks if the guess matches the solution and ends the game if correct.

5. **`make_solution()`**  
   Randomly selects a word from a predefined list of 10 words.

   ```python
   words = ["WHICH", "THEIR", "THERE", "WOULD", "OTHER", "THESE", "ABOUT", "FIRST", "COULD", "AFTER"]
   ```

2. **Word Length**  
   This program supports only 5-letter words. Update the word list and adjust the logic in functions if you want to support other lengths.
